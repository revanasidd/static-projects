											<b><p><li> Sarawad village in Vijayapura taluk, with a population of 7,000-8,000 people, had never been lucky enough to have pure drinking water and the bracki sh water they got was not fit for drinking or crops. The villagers' search for water continued even after Independence and many efforts were made to find good water -- bore wells were dug, but yielded brackish water too, leaving people disappointed

											<b><p><li>The old common well, constructed in 1968, was called the Peersab Gonad because it was located near the Sufi saint Peerasab's digraph, and was in a dilapidated condition. It had been the main source of drinking water for the village for three decades, and did not dry up even during the summers.  It was the Multi Village Drinking Water System scheme which brought hope to the villagers</b></li></p>
