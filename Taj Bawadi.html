									Taj Bawadi is a great water tank built by the Ibrahim’s II for the remembrance his first wife Taj Sultana. This is an arch surrounded by two octagonal towers in its front and the east and west wings of the towers form rest houses. This famous well is situated in the heart of the Bijapur city. One of the mythologies with this well is that once a stone is thrown from one end it does not reach the other end. It is believed that this well has more than 100 feet depth.
									<h2><u><b><i><font color="blue">History of Taj Bawadi</font></i></b></u></h2><li>Taj Bawadi, the living well of Bijapur is one the main source of water during Adil Shahi Dynasty. This enhancing bawadi is always filled with water till about three centuries ago with the unique architecture, attractive carvings and grandeur of Adil Shahi's Dynasty. Adil shahis were very famous for their able administration and love for music. They are also recognized for the excellent water supply schemes that they were implemented. There are lots of historical evidences to show that they have owned deep knowledge about water harvesting.<br><br>However they did not considered water as mere daily necessity, they also considered it as a luxury commodity to indulge in water sports. The water is supplied to the inner part of the cities through the tunnels to bawadies by collecting the water in the hills outside the Bijapur city. Historians says that the density of population was very high in Bijapur during the reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah II and Mohammed Adil Shah so the city probably consumed double the quantity of water it needed.</li><br>
									<h2><u><b><i><font color="blue">Features of Taj Bawadi</font></i></b></u></h2>Bawdies are the other name of wells and there are numerous bawadies in Bijapur. Of these, Taj Bawadi is one of the biggest one and attracts the visitors due to its artistic excellence. Among all the bawadies in Bijapur, Taj Bawdy occupies the first place with its size and grandeur. Taj Bawdi is a square shaped water tank and passage runs along the entrance with halting rooms at its left, right and in the front. The parapet walls opposite to the entrance of the bawadi are decorated with carved arches and Taj Bawadi is differing from each bawadies in Bijapur by its architecture significance.<br>

									</li><br/>
									<li><p>M.B. Patil, district In-charge Minister, has mobilised various major contractors and industries to offer financial aid under Corporate Social Responsibility to revive these bawadis.</p>
									</li>
									<li><p>Mr. Patil, who received an estimate from Krishna Bhagya Jal Nigam Ltd. for the revival of the bawadis, has entrusted the job to the city corporation to be complete in a time-bound manner.</p>
									</li>
									<li><p>Harsha Shetty, Corporation Commissioner, told The Hindu that of the total estimated ₹4.11 crore, the corporation has received ₹2.5 crore which is being used for the ambitious project. Mr. Shetty said that of the total 16 selected bawadis, the work is under way in six, including the largest and most iconic Taj Bawadi of the city. “For the first phase, we have selected these six bawadis. The remaining will be taken up when we receive more funds and permission from ASI as some of the wells fall under ASI limits,” he said. He added that the corporation plans to complete the revival before the monsoon.</p>

									<li><p>With regard to Taj Bawadi, Mr. Shetty said that heavy machines of 110HP have been used to draw water. “After drawing out the water, the next big challenge is to remove the silt that is accumulated for decades. We will remove the silt and then erect a fence around the bawadi to prevent people from immersing Ganesh idols or throwing garbage into it,” he said</p>
									</li>
									<li><p>Meanwhile, many people are happy to learn that Taj Bawadi was being cleaned. Some claim that it was about fifteen years ago, that the effort was made to remove the water and clear the Bawadi, but the job remained incomplete.</p>
									</li>
									<li><p>According to historians, the square-shaped gigantic Taj Bawadi was built by Ibrahim Adil Shah-II for the people of the city. For decades, it was a main source of water to city during the Adil Shahi era. But over time, owing to lack of maintenance, the water got contaminated owing to dumping.</p>
